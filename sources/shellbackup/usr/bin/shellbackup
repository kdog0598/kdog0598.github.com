You can backup on any firmware or device and restore them to any other firmware or other device as long as both are supported by shellbackup and have it installed. Simply copy the file shellbackup.zip from /var/mobile and paste it to the other device or other firmware of the same device at /var/mobile. Then type restoreall as the root user to restore this data. Some older firmwares may not support all things backed up by newer firmwares or devices. && echo && echo Type the following commands for more info about backing up apps separately && echo && echo && echo shellmessages && echo shellphotos && echo shellcontacts
