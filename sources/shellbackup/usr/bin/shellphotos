Type restorephotos as the root user to restore the backup at /var/mobile/shellbackup/DCIM. && echo && echo How to backup the photos app and restore them to a different device or firmware && echo && echo Backups are cross firmware and cross device compatible. You can backup the photos app on any firmware or device and restore them to any other firmware or device as long as both are supported by shellbackup. And have it installed. Simply copy the directory DCIM from /var/mobile/shellbackup and paste it to the other device or other firmware of the same device at /var/mobile/shellbackup. Some older versions of the photos app don’t support newer features of the modern versions.  If you restore a backup to a lower firmware, some features may be missing. Any idevice that doesn’t support natively recording video will not show video restored to the app.
