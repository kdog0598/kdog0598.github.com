You can backup messages on any firmware or device and restore them to any other firmware or other device as long as both are supported by shellmessages and have it installed. Simply copy the directory SMS from /var/mobile/shellbackup and paste it to the other device or firmware of the same device at /var/mobile/shellbackup. The iPhone OS 2.x sms app does not have support for mms features, and pictures will not show up if a backup for a higher firmware is restored to an iPhone OS 2.x device.
