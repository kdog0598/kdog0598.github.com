You can backup contacts on any firmware or device and restore them to any other firmware or other device as long as both are supported by shellbackup. And have it installed. Simply copy the directory AddressBook from /var/mobile/shellbackup and paste it to the other device or firmware of the same device at /var/mobile/shellbackup. Some older versions of the contacts app donâ€™t support newer features of the modern versions.  If you restore a backup to a lower firmware, some features might be missing.
